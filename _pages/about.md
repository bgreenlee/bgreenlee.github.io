## About the Site

The word [footle](http://www.wordnik.com/words/footle) popped up as a Word of the Day some years back and I thought it was appropriate for a personal site.

This site is generated with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), using the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) theme. It's hosted on [Github](https://github.com/bgreenlee/bgreenlee.github.io).
