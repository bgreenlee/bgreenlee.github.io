This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on footle.org and any apps for iPhone, MacOS, or other platforms published by Brad Greenlee.

## Information we collect

Currently no personal information outside of location is collected by this website or any of our applications. Several of our applications make use of location information:
- [Sunrise in Your Menu Bar](https://footle.org/sunrise) asks you to share your location for the sole purpose of determining the sunrise and sunset time for your longitude and latitude. Sharing your location is optional, and the location information is stored only on the local device.
- [Wanderings](https://wanderin.gs) asks to share your location information continually. This information is stored only on your device and in your personal iCloud account.

## California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.

## Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance

We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

## Information for European Union Customers

By using our products and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your information outside of the European Union.

## International Transfers of Information
