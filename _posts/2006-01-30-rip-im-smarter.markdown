My <a href="http://www.imsmarter.com">imsmarter</a> proxy stopped working last week, and I just got around to going to their site to see what was up. Looks like they've shut down. A bit of a pity; I thought it was a useful service. I use IM on four different machines and it made finding something from a past conversation a lot easier. Actually, though, what I used most often was its reminder feature. I could send it an IM saying "Remind me in 2 hours to check the car" and it would do just that, saving me many parking tickets. I imagine there are other services like that out there; I should check around. Actually, that would be a pretty trival thing to implement myself. Hmmm.
