From a cookbook by the Ladies Auxillary of some hospital in Rhode Island:

Scrumptions Muffins

1 cup softened vanilla ice cream
1 cup sifted self-rising flour

Mix well. Pour into a muffin tin lined with paper cups, about 3/4 full. Bake at 350 F for 20 min.

You know you want to make them. I know I will.

<b>Update:</b> Made them. I had to improvise a bit, as I didn't have self-rising flour. I added about 1/2 tsp. of baking powder instead. They were pretty bad. Very dense. Must have been the flour.
