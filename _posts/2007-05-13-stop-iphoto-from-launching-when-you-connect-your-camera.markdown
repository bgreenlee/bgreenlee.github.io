It took me a bit of digging to find this, so I thought I may as well spread the word here. I've started using Adobe Lightroom for managing my photos, but every time I connect my camera or card reader to import photos, iPhoto would launch, and I couldn't figure out where I could change that. I finally discovered that the setting is in the Image Capture application. Run that, then go to Preferences and you'll find it there. Why they wouldn't also put it in iPhoto, Lightroom, or even on a preferences panel is beyond me.
