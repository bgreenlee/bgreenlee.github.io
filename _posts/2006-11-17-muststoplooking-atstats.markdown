I've been too tired today to do any actual work, so I've spent much of the day camping out on the <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">Wesabe</a> site stats. It's terribly exciting having so many people hitting your site and so many signing up (almost 1/3 of our unique visitors have created accounts). The site has been humming along beautifully, too--major props goes out my colleague <a href="http://blog.codahale.com/">Coda Hale</a> for his Apache/Mongrel/Pen prowess.

Anyway, I just wanted to share one of the more interesting stats from our analytics (<a href="http://www.haveamint.com/">Mint</a>--very tasty):

That's a lovely thing to see. Granted, these are largely very tech-savvy, early-adopter people at this stage, but it's heartening to see IE getting the beatdown.
