Clay Shirky has a great piece about ontologies, categorization, and how they don't really make sense for most of the Web today: <strong><a href="http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html">Ontology is Overrated</a></strong>

Paul Graham's new essay tries to make some sense of everyone's favorite buzzword: <strong><a href="http://paulgraham.com/web20.html">Web 2.0</a></strong>

Happy Thanksgiving!
