<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/bonjour/">Bonjour</a>-enabled <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a>. (Although <a href="http://blog.codahale.com">Coda</a> tells me that Dave F. at <a href="http://powerset.com">Powerset</a> already approached him with this idea. Neither of us have time to work on it.)

I started using Git recently and although it's a bit confounding at times, I love how cheap and easy branching is, and that you can commit incremental changes to your local repository, then later commit them in batch to subversion. Git allows for distributed development, but unless you're on the same server as other developers, or you go through the trouble of mounting their repository over the network, you can't check out their repository. Seems like it shouldn't be too difficult to give Git Bonjour powers.
