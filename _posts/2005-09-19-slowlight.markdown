<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spotlight/">Spotlight</a> was a great addition to OS X, and it works great for finding things buried in your filesystem. But for anyone used to <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/">Quicksilver</a> or <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/">LaunchBar</a>, it is painfully slow as an application launcher, which is really all I need most of the time. I recently reinstalled Quicksilver and I don't think I've touched Spotlight since then.</p>
