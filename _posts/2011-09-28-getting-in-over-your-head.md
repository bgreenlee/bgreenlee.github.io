In college I majored in Computer Science, but we were required to take a certain number of credits of a foreign language. Rather than take the easier path of continuing the German I took in high school, I started from scratch with Japanese, which also happened to be one of most intensive language programs there.

My reasons for taking Japanese were a bit fuzzy. I thought I might want to go into "business," and I thought that Japanese would be the business language of the future. But mostly I think I just wanted to learn something completely new and different from anything I had learned before.

(it doesn't always work out:)

At the same time, during my sophomore year, I took a graduate level math course on abstract algebra. It wasn't entirely my idea--I was swayed by a good friend of mine, also a sophomore (who was minoring in math), who wanted to take it, and the presence of a hallmate, who was a *freshman*, albeit an utter genius in math.

The class was *way* over my head, as well as my friend's. We would spend many hours trying to work through the weekly homework assignments together, often getting completely stuck, at which point we'd go visit the freshman math genius, who was invariably playing video games, and he would say "Oh, I haven't looked at it yet. Come back in 20 minutes." We would, and he'd hand us his completed homework and go back to his video game. We'd then go away and spend several more hours trying to make sense of his answers.

Needless to say, I didn't fare well in that class (not to mention that the professor was clearly peeved that there were a bunch of underclassmen who had the audacity to take his graduate-level course, although the freshman math genius aced it). But I learned that higher-level math was not my fort√©.

When I first started crossfit, some of the workouts seemed incredibly daunting, and the performances I was seeing from some people (who had been doing it for a while) seemed impossible. But after four years of Crossfit, I am regularly turning in the best times/scores of my class, and have placed in the last two competitions I've participated in.
