John C. Dvorak has a <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1916760,00.asp">good piece</a> at pcmag.com about speculations that Google is going to be creating their own network (see the "Google is the Internet" scenario from the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2006/01/01/8368125/index.htm">article linked in my previous post</a>). I certainly hope they do, as telcos have been <a href="http://muniwireless.com/community/1023">dragging their feet</a> on broadband for a long time, and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2005-01-03-fiber-cover_x.htm">acting like the Mafia</a> whenever someone encroaches on "their" territory.
