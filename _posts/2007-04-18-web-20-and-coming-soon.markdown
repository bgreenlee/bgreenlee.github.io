Marc and I presented our <a href="http://www.web2expo.com/cs/webex2007/view/e_sess/11865">Super Ninja Privacy Techniques for Web App Developers</a> talk again yesterday at <a href="http://www.web2expo.com/">Web 2.0</a> (we also did it at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/">ETech</a> last month), and it seemed well received. I still need to work on my presentation skills; I'm not an old hand at this like Marc is.

I'm working on a follow-up to my <a href="http://blog.footle.org/2007/02/22/protecting-your-users-data-with-a-privacy-wall/">privacy wall</a> post which will describe a much better way to go about keeping a user's private data private, using an encrypted "Locker". I'll also go into detail about how we deal with password recovery.

Hopefully by preannouncing this, I'll force myself to get off my duff and finish the post. So stay tuned, and bug me if I don't have it up soon.
