The importance of sucking.

One of the defining charactaristics of a successful programmer is being OK with the feeling that you have no idea what you're doing. I've been programming for over 30 years and it still happens to me regularly. The key is pushing on through that dark period, trusting that eventually you'll catch a glimmer of light and it will slowly start to make sense.

There are a few tricks I've picked up to help me get over that initial hump. The first is to find a tutorial someone has written, and just follow along, just to get *something* working. Once I have something working, no matter how basic, not only do I start to get a better sense of how all the pieces fit together, but I can start tweaking it and learn from how it responds.

Can't find a good tutorial? Great! Here's your opportunity to give back, and write your own. There's really no better way to learn. Start with doing the most basic thing imaginable. Just get something working. Write down your steps as you go. Then add to it, write it down, repeat. You'll eventually have something coherent that you can post, and you'll earn a ton of internet karma points.

It also really helps if you have a specific project to work on, otherwise the tutorial can be a bit of a dead end, and your effort can feel purposeless. Don't have a project, and can't think of one? Rewrite something you've already written. Ask friends and family if there's an app they wish they had. Write a basic version of an app that you're too cheap to buy. Write a [todo app](http://todomvc.com/).

Start small, though; the bigger the project, the less likely you are to finish it. [Minimum viable product (MVP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) isn't just Silicon Valley jargon; it applies equally well to personal projects. Do the simplest, dumbest thing possible. It's easy to iterate and improve once you have something working, and you can always throw it all away and rewrite it once you feel you know what you're doing.

The feeling of sucking at something and being completely lost is a part of learning. Everyone starts out that way. If you're actively avoiding sucking, you're not learning. Get lost. Seriously, find someplace to get yourself lost. You'll be better for it. Then tell us about it when you inevitably emerge from the darkness.
