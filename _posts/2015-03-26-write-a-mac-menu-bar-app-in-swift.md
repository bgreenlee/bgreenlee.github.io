This past week I taught an [Etsy School](https://blog.etsy.com/news/2013/about-us-etsy-school/) class on how to [write an OS X menu bar (aka status bar) app in Swift](http://footle.org/WeatherBar/), and the walk-through is now public. I hope you find it useful.

If you have any suggestions on improving it, [let me know](mailto:brad@footle.org). ([Or better yet, submit a PR!](https://github.com/bgreenlee/WeatherBar/pulls))
