My colleague Coda Hale just released a sweet <a href="http://blog.codahale.com/2007/02/28/bcrypt-ruby-secure-password-hashing/">bcrypt-ruby gem</a> that does password hashing right. It also provides for future-proofing by enabling you to assign a computational cost for generating a password hash and letting you version your password hashes. You have no more excuses.
