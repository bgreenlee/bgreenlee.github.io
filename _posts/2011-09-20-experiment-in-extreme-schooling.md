Fascinating article about a New York Times writer who moves to Russia with his family, and immerses his kids in a Russian school.

What really resonated with me is just how resilient kids are. I often catch myself thinking that my own girls aren't ready for something, that it will be too hard for them, but that's a dangerous attitude to have. Much better to believe that they can do anything, because chances are, they can.
