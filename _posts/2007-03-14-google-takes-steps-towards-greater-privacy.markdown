Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/03/taking-steps-to-further-improve-our.html">recently announced</a> that it will soon start anonymizing search logs older than 18-24 months. Full details can be found in their <a href="http://216.239.57.110/blog_resources/google_log_retention_policy_faq.pdf">Log Retention Policy FAQ (PDF)</a>. This is a heartening step back towards their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Be_Evil">"Don't Be Evil"</a> corporate philosophy, which some think has been largely <a href="http://breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8FBCF686&show_article=1">abandoned</a>.

I've just recently started using <a href="http://www.scroogle.org/">Scroogle</a> as a way of defeating their tracking of my every search (their site is awful; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scroogle">Wikipedia</a> has more readable information about the project), although the motives of the man behind it, Daniel Brandt, who also runs the <a href="http://www.google-watch.org/">Google Watch</a> site, <a href="http://www.google-watch-watch.org/">may be questionable</a>. Still, he doesn't have much incentive for keeping a log of queries and IP addresses, and if he did, since he's not giving me a cookie, he can't tie all my searches together.
