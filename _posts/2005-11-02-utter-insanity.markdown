Video of Dan Osman speed-soloing up Bear's Reach at Lover's Leap (near South Lake Tahoe, CA). Need I say don't try this at home? <a href="http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/1220/">http://www.ebaumsworld.com/video/watch/1220/</a>

(I've done this route, but it took me more like 2 hours--not 4 minutes and 25 seconds.)

I'm not sure when this video was shot, but I think it was not long before his death on November 23, 1998. He was always a huge risk-taker, and one of his hobbies was taking very long falls on climbing ropes. He died attempting a 925-foot fall on rigging that he had left up in Yosemite in the rain and snow for over a month. Pretty stupid.

Here's a good article about Dan: <a href="http://outside.away.com/magazine/0499/9904terminal.html">
