> A couple of weeks ago, a friend of mine and I were talking about a study 
she'd just read, which concluded that people without children were happier than 
people with children; or, to put it more precisely, despite what conventional 
wisdom holds, the study found that having children did not increase anyone's 
happiness.

> At which all I could do was burst out laughing.  Because, well.  Duh.

> Only an academic would undertake a study like this, defining happiness as 
something along the lines of "satisfaction with life" and "feeling rewarded by 
your work." If there's an occupation more likely to make you feel incompetent 
and unrewarded than being a parent, I have never heard of it.
