I wrote a Slack bot, [ReadBot](https://github.com/bgreenlee/readbot), to both scratch an itch and check out the current state of Slack integration. As a bonus, I got to spend some time getting familiar with [Glitch](https://glitch.com), a pretty cool live coding platform.

ReadBot lets you connect your [Goodreads](https://goodreads.com) and [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) accounts to Slack, and then adding a `bookmark` (üîñ) reactji to a message with an Amazon book link in it will add that book to your Goodreads "to-read" shelf, or any other URL to your Pocket account.

The [Slack API](https://api.slack.com) and documentation has improved immensely since I last checked it out a couple years ago. I was clearly not the only one to get confused by profusion of integration options (bot? slash command? webhook?) , so they‚Äôve improved their API landing pages to [help guide you](https://api.slack.com/slack-apps). There are also plenty of tutorials to get you started.

One of the fears when diving into an API integration is whether that API‚Äîor even integrations in general‚Äîare going to be supported in the future. Many developers have been burned by neglected, [deprecated](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/01/30/instagram-graph-api-updates/) or even [shutdown](https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/16/netflix-api/) APIs. Slack, however, seems to be encouraging integrations whole-heartedly with its [app directory](https://slack.com/apps).

One challenge of creating a new Slack integration has been Slack‚Äôs requirement that it be served over SSL. While [Let‚Äôs Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) has made this a lot easier, setting up an SSL-enabled server is still a significant hurdle to clear just to start developing your integration. This is where [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) comes in.

Glitch is a collaborative live coding environment made by [Fog Creek Software](https://fogcreek.cohttps://fogcreek.com/). It‚Äôs super easy to get started, especially since you can find existing public projects on the site and ‚Äúremix‚Äù them to make them your own. And every project has its own SSL-enabled hostname, right out of the box.

Glitch apps are Node.js-based (they seem to allow Python apps as well, but support is currently unofficial). The app restarts itself on the fly as you edit (although this can be disabled), so your app is always live. Autocomplete package search makes installing new packages a breeze. You can do pretty much everything you need to through the UI, but if you need, you can drop into a shell and do whatever you like to your instance.

There‚Äôs no built-in revision/commit history, but you can export your project to GitHub (as well as import from GitHub). Since your app is just a regular Node app, it‚Äôs perfectly portable to any other environment.

One general issue with writing Slack bots is that in order to continue working on your app after it is in production, you need to have separate development apps and endpoints. It would be nice if Slack made this a little easier, perhaps by allowing you to specify separate production and development endpoints, slash commands, etc.

I have no plans on publishing ReadBot to the Slack App Directory because I don‚Äôt want to have to maintain another production service. If you‚Äôre interested in doing so, go for it.
