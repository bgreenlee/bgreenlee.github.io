Chris Anderson of <a href="http://www.wired.com">Wired</a> / <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com">The Long Tail</a> has started a wiki page to track <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/the_long_tail/2005/12/announcing_the_.html">public blogs by Fortune 500 companies</a>. The list isn't terribly long yet, but I'm sure it will be growing, both as more people discover existing company blogs and as more companies jump on the bandwagon.

Speaking of which, we've jumped on the bandwagon ourselves at <a href="http://www.triporama.com">Triporama</a>. The <a href="http://www.triporama.com/blog">Triporama Blog</a> isn't yet linked in from the main site (it will be soon), but Wendell has already posted a great piece about the origins of Triporama.

Happy New Year!
