It's been a bit over a year since I was [laid off from Etsy](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/etsy-laying-off-11percent-of-staff-citing-competitive-environment.html), where I'd been for 11Â½ years. Although everyone will tell you not to take a layoff personally, it still stings knowing that someone decided you were not worth keeping around. That said, the layoffs seemed to hit old-timers and remotes particularly hard, so the deck was stacked against me.

It wasn't hard for me to decide not to go looking for another full-time job. I'd long fantasized about being an indie software developer, working on my own things and setting my own schedule, so I guess that's what I was now.

I started an [LLC](https://greenlee.dev) for all the amazing apps I was going to start writing, but then some consulting fell into my lap. (Coincidentally, this same thing happened to me the last time I was laid off, nearly 25 years ago. I had been working in San Francisco during the dot-com boom and when the company went under I was all set to move to [Bishop](https://bishopvisitor.com/rock-climbing-bouldering/) and become a climbing bum for a year, when a friend pinged me and I ended up spending the next four years consulting.)

I spent a couple months with [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org) creating [data modeling guidelines](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_Platform/Data_modeling_guidelines). I learned that WMF has some really interesting and unique challenges, both technically and politically. It's a really great group of folks.

That was followed a by a much bigger consulting opportunity, which lead to starting [another LLC with some friends](https://fiasco.partners). We spend about six months tackling a pretty hairy data engineering challenge. What I learned from that is if you see NetSuite, run.

Around the paid gigs I also spent some time helping out one friend with their [startup](https://comprendo.dev) and another with his [app](https://museumistic.app).

I've been keeping myself pretty busy since that last gig ended. I spent a good amount of time doing a deep dive into [MacOS aerial screensavers/wallpapers](https://github.com/bgreenlee/WallpaperInfo). I wrote a [Safari extension to redact news articles](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i-cant-even-news-filter/id6738306756). I wrote a [little web game](https://licenseplategame.fun). I also spent a good amount of December doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com), working on my Swift and SwiftUI skills in the process.

I'll write separate posts about all of those projects, but I'm currently mulling over what to do next. I recently got a 3D printer, so playing with that and learning a bit of CAD has been taking a lot of my time, but that's not nearly as fulfilling as a good project is.

So after a year of being "indie," I'm still pretty sure I'm never going back to a full-time jobby-job. I do miss my colleagues at Etsy, and there's something to be said about being part of a team and a larger mission, but I do not miss all the overhead that comes with working at a "large" company ("work about work"). I love waking up every day knowing that I have zero meetings and what I want to accomplish that day is entirely up to me. Literally whatever.

Now to just come up with that killer app idea....
