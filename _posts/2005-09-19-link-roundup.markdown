Some random interesting stories/links I've run across in the last week or so:

<p><a href="http://www.lennyjones.net/burn2005/comicbook2005.htm">Photos from this year's Burning Man</a> in the form of a graphic novel. Very nicely done.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/?p=893">With an audio recording of you typing away at your computer for 10 minutes, it's possible to figure out everything you typed.</a> (via <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram.html">Crypto-Gram</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_4200000/newsid_4209000/4209004.stm">Tongue-eating bug found in fish.</a> So gross, but so cool. (via <a href="http://boingboing.net/">Boing-Boing</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hotflashgames.com/wordpads.htm">Word Pads</a>, a very addictive word game. My high score so far is <strike>only around 5000</strike> 18575.</p>

<p>I didn't really discover this in the last week, but it's too cool not to get a mention: the <a href="http://www.sueandpaul.com/gmapPedometer/?centerX=-122.35782623291016&centerY=37.7916084854395&zl=5&fl=m-e-h-0-1&polyline=">Gmaps  Pedometer</a> (the link centers on a more interesting location than the default of Hoboken, NJ). It's a testament to the brilliance of the Google folks that people have been able to come up with great hacks like this.</p>

<p>Finally, I'm going to try to play in the upcoming Ultimate Frisbee regionals, despite not having played since last winter, mostly due to my crappy back. I think I can hold it together for a weekend. Or at least a day. But this has inspired me: <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/sports/article1115952.ece">a 67-year old man comes out of retirement to play for his soccer team in their time of need.</a> (via <a href="http://www.fark.com">Fark</a>)</p>
