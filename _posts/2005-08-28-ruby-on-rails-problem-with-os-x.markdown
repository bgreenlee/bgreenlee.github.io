<p>I've been playing around with <a href="http://www.rubycentral.com/">Ruby</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> lately. I'm not that far into it yet, but they both look interesting. I'll write more about my experiences later.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you're setting this up on a Mac (running Tiger) like I am, do yourself a favor and before you start getting into any of the Rails tutorials (like <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html?page=1">Rolling With Ruby on Rails</a>), go here first:</p> 

<p><a href="http://www.juju.org/archives/2005/08/06/ruby-on-rails-mysql-and-osx-tiger-woes">Ruby On Rails, Mysql, and OSX Tiger Woes</a></p>

<p>Do what it says (including <a href="http://tech.rufy.com/entry/46">the fix</a> it mentions), and you'll save yourself a lot of grief. Note that as one of the commentors mentions, it works just fine with <a href="http://tmtm.org/downloads/mysql/ruby/mysql-ruby-2.7.tar.gz">mysql-ruby-2.7</a> also.</p>

<p>Back to my tutorial...</p>
