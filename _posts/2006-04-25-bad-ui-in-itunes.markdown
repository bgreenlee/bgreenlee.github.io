I use iTunes both on a Mac and Windows. In OS X, Command-H hides an app, something I do so often I just do it without thinking. However, in iTunes on Windows, Control-H (aka backspace) deletes whatever object you're on, with no undo. I just deleted a playlist I had spent a long time working on and I see no way to get it back.

Why don't I at least have the option to undo? Terrible UI.  Surprising that Apple of all companies made such a basic mistake.
