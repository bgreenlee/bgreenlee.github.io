## Prose.io

[Prose.io](http://prose.io) is a content editor for GitHub. It supports [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) sites (like this one), and provides [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) previews. I'm writing this post using it.

I'm sure I looked at Prose some time ago, but must have decided something was lacking. But I just took a look at it again, and it's just what I need. In fact, I had started a similar project myself not long ago, and now I feel relieved that I can officially call it dead and stop fretting about having stalled out on it.
