<p>In lieu of anything else interesting to post, I'll clear out some of the links I've been saving:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://writeboard.com/">Writeboard</a></strong><br />
I haven't had the opportunity to really use this yet, but it looks like a pretty cool collaboration tool. No more sending Word docs back and forth. It's also packaged with their equally cool <a href="http://backpackit.com">Backpack</a> app.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://aurgasm.us/">Aurgasm</a></strong><br />
I'm a bit late in the game here, but I've just started discovering the wonderful world of MP3 blogs. All sorts of great, eclectic music, for free. There are more MP3 blogs out there than you can shake your booty at, but this is one of my favorites.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/improvingprint">Improving Link Display for Print</a></strong><br />
Absolutely ingenious. Using CSS & Javascript, you can automatically list all links on the print version of your web page as footnotes. I'm going to have to give it a shot on this site.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.copilot.com/">Fog Creek Copilot</a></strong><br />
For anyone who is, like I am, the person family and friends turn to when they have computer problems, this looks like a godsend for those trickier issues. Yes, computer remote control software is nothing new, but the really ingenious thing here is how easy it is to get someone set up. You just sign up with the site and give the person you're helping a code. They go to the site, enter the code, download the necessary software, and you're connected.</p>
