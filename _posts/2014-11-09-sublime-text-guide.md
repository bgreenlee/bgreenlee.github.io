I'm a big fan of the [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) text editor, and I've become one of its biggest evangelists at Etsy. A few months ago I gave an internal presentation/tutorial session on it, and used those notes to create a guide on our internal wiki. I've ported that guide to my blog so I can spread the Good Word to others. Since the [source code for my blog](https://github.com/bgreenlee/bgreenlee.github.io) is available publicly, I'm also hoping that people will help make it even better.

So head over to my [Sublime Text Guide](/sublime-text/) and let me know what you think.
