[Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) is a great language, and far more enjoyable to program in than Objective-C, but it is still in its infancy, and bugs abound. One of the more frustrating is compiler errors that are flat-out wrong. Take a look at this (in Xcode 6.1):

![Could not find member](/images/could_not_find_member.png)

"Could not find member 'date'?" Trust me when I tell you that `date` is indeed a member of a `Todo` object. So what's going on? Let's tweak it a bit:

![Cannot invoke](/images/could_not_find_member_better.png)

Ah, there we go. Turns out you can't actually compare dates like that (hmm...I smell a follow-up post on writing extensions). Here's how you do it:

![Fixed](/images/could_not_find_member_fixed.png)

Here's another one. The following is essentially a no-op:

```swift
for i in 0..<0 {
    println(i)
}
```

That's just a for loop from zero up to, but not including, zero. And this code is fine, doing what it is supposed to doâ€”nothing.

However, try making the ending value of the loop negative. This should be equivalent to the above:

```swift
for i in 0...(-1) {
    println(i)
}
```

The `...` operator means "up to and including". So this should also be a no-op (and it is in most programming languages). But:

![For Loop Boom](/images/for_loop_boom_1.png)

Even worse, it will actually crash on the first executable line of code:

![For Loop Boom 2](/images/for_loop_boom_2.png)

None of this should scare you away from using Swift. It's a fun language to work with, and ends up being much more concise than Objective-C. Just keep in mind that there are still bugs to be worked out, and if you're getting errors that just make no sense, there's a fair chance you've hit one.
