<p>Joel Spolsky's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html">latest article</a> is largely a rehash of <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000074.html">one of his earliest articles</a>, whereby he expounds on his belief (which I share) that there's no substitute for top-notch programmers. The thing that got me thinking was his  "shaky claim that most people are wrong in thinking you need an idea to make a successful software company," and this chart:</p>

<p>The problem I have with this is that you still need a pretty good idea to start with, or you're never going to get the best programmers in the first place. Great programmers aren't in it for the money; they want to work on stuff that interests them. Cool stuff. Sexy stuff. Having a great working environment with lots of other great programmers around is a big draw too, but how are you going to achieve that without the great idea in the first place?</p>

<p>This hits a chord with me because I know a lot of great programmers with whom I would love to start a company, but I've been waiting for the perfect idea to come along and it hasn't. But perhaps the trick is to just come up with a good-enough idea -- good enough to get one or two other great programmers to dive into it with you -- and just take it from there. </p>

<p>So...who's got a good-enough idea?</p>
