I scratched an itch last week and actually wrote some code (these days my primary IDE is Google Docs). Check out [humanize](https://github.com/bgreenlee/humanize), which replaces any large numbers in text piped into it with shortened versions using [SI prefix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix) symbols (K, M, G, T, etc.). So “File size: 972917401236” becomes “File size: 973G”.

This came about because I was debugging an issue with a [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) file using [parquet-tools](https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/tree/master/parquet-tools), whose output looks like:

	% parquet-tools meta part-01373-r-01373.gz.parquet | grep "row group"
	row group 1:           RC:100 TS:121513011 OFFSET:4 
	row group 2:           RC:100 TS:44877183 OFFSET:14293218 
	row group 3:           RC:111 TS:28645460 OFFSET:19704281 
	row group 4:           RC:168 TS:31794536 OFFSET:23387243 
	row group 5:           RC:363 TS:28078938 OFFSET:27531686 
	row group 6:           RC:15547 TS:899825873 OFFSET:31242035 
	row group 7:           RC:9963 TS:47930700 OFFSET:142353955 
	row group 8:           RC:20100 TS:911417774 OFFSET:155302131 
	row group 9:           RC:20100 TS:889810662 OFFSET:269749697 
	row group 10:          RC:10100 TS:855908709 OFFSET:382090935 
	row group 11:          RC:7282 TS:1532744480 OFFSET:486019001 

Tired of squinting and counting digits to see how big some of these numbers were, I figured there’d be some easy bash/sed way to convert these numbers into something more readable. It is pretty easy to do this for isolated numbers using `numfmt`: 

	% echo "1234567890" | numfmt --to=si --round=nearest
	1.2G

But that doesn’t work on numbers embedded in text:

	% echo "This is a big number: 1234567890" | numfmt --to=si --round=nearest
	numfmt: invalid number: ‘This’

GNU sed can do a replacement with the result of a function, but it’s rather ugly:

	% echo "This is a big number: 1234567890" | sed -re 's/[0-9]+/`numfmt --to=si --round=nearest &`/g;s/.*/echo &/;e'
	This is a big number: 1.2G

But I’m doing this work on a Mac, which does not come with GNU sed (or numfmt, for that matter, although you can `brew install coreutils` to get gnumfmt). I started working on a perl one-liner to do it, but decided this was something that needed to exist on its own, and should be easy for anyone to install.

I chose to write it in Go because it has an easy way for people to install binaries with `go get`. (Rust has something similar with `cargo install`, but Go is more common in my workplace.) The problem with `go get` is that you have to run it again to upgrade, so for my fellow Mac users I added a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap.

Long story short:

	% parquet-tools meta part-01373-r-01373.gz.parquet | grep "row group" | humanize -binary
