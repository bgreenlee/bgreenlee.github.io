<p>Some insight to be gleaned here:</p>

<p>I don't completely agree with all of his "steps", particularly the examples he provides. Take #7--Get people hooked on free--for example. Yes, free will always win you fans, and a large user base has intrinsic value, but if you're providing a service that people are willing to pay for, by all means let them pay.  (Regarding his Thefacebook vs. Match.com example--which one is actually making money?)  Still, there are some good ones. My favorite: <b>6.  Be mindnumbingly simple.</b> Then again, this is a pretty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">age-old design mantra.</a></p>
