Somebody has deemed today Embrace Your Geekness Day. So what better way to celebrate than post to my blog.

I searched around for information about the origins of this holiday, but found nothing other than lists of other obscure days (July 15th is Respect Canada Day!). How does one get a day proclaimed anyway? There are some openings left; one calendar I looked at had the 29th and 31st of this month still open. How about a Wear Flip-Flops to Work Day? (Googling for that came up with a <a href="http://ubersite.com/m/38413">single hit</a>.)
